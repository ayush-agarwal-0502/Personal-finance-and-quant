# Personal-finance-and-quant

Tested some of my hypothesis and here are results . Someone teach me real quant plz tho .

My salary is x base , so using 50:30:20 rule I would have around x/5 to invest , and using 100-age rule , I would have 4x/25 for equity and rest for debt . (I dont wanna reveal my salary but those who know me already know these numbers)

My Q - Since there are so many tax slabs and stuff its hard to imagine how much tax will be taken away as a percentage of salary .

Now ik why ppl commit tax fraud (XD joking plz dont send income tax dept me no money) 

My Q - If I randomly threw money in Nifty (or any Index fund) for x years (x from 1 to 12ish) at any random month how would my returns vary across the years ?

As we see , unless u are really unlucky, ur money has to double within 7-8 yrs . Using rule of 72, 72/8 = 9% **inflation adjusted** CAGR which is very good imo .  

My Q - Usually all sites only show past 1 3 and 5 yr CAGR , given that a mutual fund beat x% (x varies from 1 to 12ish on this plot) in past 1 and 3 yrs what is the chance it will beat x% after 2 years ? 

Data - 
* https://www.etmoney.com/mutual-funds/filter/annual-returns Excel has a very good "Get Data" button which scraps the data given the website. 

My Ans - u have to be as unlucky as picking an orange dot among the green dots on the right top side of the red dotted lines

Life update - So I think I can randomly pick a mutual fund and it will go well 

If u read so far just teach me how to build a quant bot so that I can beat these above returns :)
